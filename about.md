---

I am a energy-power professional with interests in energy value chain. I study methods of energy production, storage, transmission, and distribution. I am currently at [Commonwealth Fusion Systems](https://www.cfs.energy/). Prior to it, I was at [Eversource Energy](https://www.eversource.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Hitachi Energy](https://www.hitachienergy.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Some of my other work around energy-water nexus can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggvoStcAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}
