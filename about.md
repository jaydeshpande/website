Hi! I'm Jaydeep. I'm working on several digitalization challenges in energy industry. I run analytics programs at <a href="https://www.eversource.com/content/general/about">Eversource Energy</a>.

<br>

Before moving to Mass, I worked at <a href="https://new.abb.com/uk/about/our-businesses/power-grids-division">ABB Power Grids</a>. where I helped build ultra-safe and oil-free distribution transformer for New York City.

<br>

I started my career as a mechanical engineering with interests in thermal and mechanical modeling, which I quite enjoyed â€” until I realized that, data and digitalization are rapidly penetrating in the energy business. Data has the power to make energy infrastructure safer, stronger and resilient. Hence, I decided to take a different path!

<br>

I like books, podcasts and cooking. I write about my ideas, experiments and experiences here. I try to send a newsletter every couple of months; if you would like to read more, subscribe maybe?
