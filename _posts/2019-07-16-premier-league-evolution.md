We had a riveting last season in Premier League football. Liverpool and Man City went up until the last game to claim the crown. Perhaps, the best moment came a little later with Liverpool's triumph in Champions League and Chelsea's in the Europa League. Both finals, by the way, being all English finals. It was said under this backdrop, that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola have changed English football for good!

I took a quick look at the data to see the trends. The top 4 teams have consistently been getting better. They have trended towards scoring more and more points collectively over the years. The last 3 data points representing Klopp-Guardiola era in the league!

Klopp-Guardiola philosophies also revolve around fluid movement and an attacking style of football. However, what's interesting to note is, in last 3 seasons, top 4 have become defensively tidier. There is no clear trend on the defensive side, whereas, top 4 are trending towards increasing their goal throughput! It won't be hard to imagine one of them scoring 100+ goals next season as well!

As we saw in the last season, winning the league could be down to 1 or 2 points. It is at this point one or two draws come to haunt the teams. Over the years, top 4 have become more efficient at clawing back in the game and converting the draws into wins! Perhaps, next season we will see even fewer draws?
